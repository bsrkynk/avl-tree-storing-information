# avl-tree-storing-information


Our goal is to add the contact data from the Kisiler.txt text file to the AVL tree. Postorder this tree structure
is to print the contact information read from the file to the screen by navigating in this way. 
In addition, these additions of each tree node
movements during the course will also be recorded and printed on the last screen.
